Animal crossing is one of my favorite games, and New horizons it's been a real helper with these tiomes we live in right now, so when the oportunity came to make a catalog as a project capstone, I didn't even hesitate.

The App can be installed through chrome an any platform (I think), or viewed from any webbrowser (except <IE8, but please stop using that)

# Try it out!!

You want to try it out without any installation? YOU CAN! Just check out the [live version](https://acnh-catalog.herokuapp.com/).

While the catalog __can__ be viewed on a pc, it was thought to be viewed on a phone, the media queries are gonna try their best to make It look good on a pc... it just looks better on a phone.
